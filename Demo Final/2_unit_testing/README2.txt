This readme refers to unit testing within the application. 

All functions and programability are executed through the web program and are currently done by hand.
There are tests to ensure the different systems are communicating, but individual functions should be 
tested manually. Within the context of the different users, the appsupport and IT admin users have 
access to built in tools that allow them to check the status of the connection to the webserver 
and view the last records received from specific sensors in order to ensure the system is functioning. 

Access is silo'd to the roll a specific user is granted. User's will lack access to pages that they should not
have access to through the use of a checks and a dynamically generated menu. Forms within the webpage
have required field and constraints are in place on the database to keep the data santized.
